# Reversi-Othello-BasicAlgorithm
Final Project For Fundamentals of Programming - Fall 2018

//In this project we must have searched for a good algorithm, manipulated it and implemented it in order to play with the tester.
//The Tester was written by our head-TA and included 5 different algorithms to play with our program.
//The program that i wrote is able to win all of those algorithms.

//The code is in the dist function.

//To Use the tester go to dist function, extract the tester, open the tester folder and run tester.exe
//Now select the program in the dist folder (SSDEBF.exe) and choose an Algorithm and press start.
//Tester plays with the program and shows you the result.

/* The project's details are included in the fp.pdf file. (in Persian)
